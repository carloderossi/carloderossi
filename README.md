# 👋 About Me

I build AI products that work in the real world — in banks, under regulation, at scale.

Currently working in Switzerland in a Swiss Financial institution, leading AI-enabled transformation of enterprise portfolios. I architected a GNN/ML clustering model analyzing **20K+ application dependencies**, delivering **CHF 50M+** in technical debt reduction.

Beyond my day job, I explore cutting-edge AI architectures through **10+ production‑grade systems**.
